	The use case diagram showcases how Admin and Customer roles interact within the system. Admins log in to access their dashboard, where they can manage items by viewing, editing, adding, and deleting. They also have the ability to view all customers, handle messages by viewing and replying, and manage orders. Admins can also view and edit their profile, delete their account, and log out. On the other hand, customers begin by registering and logging in. Once logged in, they can browse products, add items to their cart, view their cart, remove items, and proceed to checkout.
